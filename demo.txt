A text file is a file containing text, but there are several ways to think about that, 
so it's important to know the kind of text document you have before dealing with a program 
that can open or convert it.
A text file contains just text (versus other content like images).
Open one with any text editor, such as Notepad or TextEdit.
Convert to other text-based formats with Notepad++ and similar tools.
